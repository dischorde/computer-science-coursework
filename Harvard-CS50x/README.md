# Harvard CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science

#### Description from edX:
"This is CS50x, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. As of Fall 2015, the on-campus version of CS50x, CS50, was Harvard's largest course.

Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project will receive a certificate from HarvardX.  

#### What you'll learn:

- A broad and robust understanding of computer science and programming
- How to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently
- Concepts like abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development
- How to develop and present a final programming project to your peers "

### About Uploaded Coursework

According to the Honor Code, no problem set solutions may be shared online. Due to this restraint I have only uploaded deprecated problem sets that are not currently part of the curriculum, and a PDF of my Quiz 0 and notes sheet. The quiz was not a class requirement, but I personally decided to take it anyway for a more complete experience. Although I did grade myself, the answer sheet is available for comparison on the course website. The version I took was the most recent available at the time (Fall 2014). 

### Grades / Progress
Problem Sets are graded out of 1, with .6 considered a passing grade.

### Final Project
My CS50 final project is a WordPress plugin to automatically import events from an RSS feed into The Events Calendar by Modern Tribe. It is hosted here: https://github.com/dischorde/rss-to-events
